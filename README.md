LAMMPS interface to compute spatially-dependent chemical potentials

## About

This repository contains a bash/json interface to calculate chemical potentials over subdomains, which can be used to calculate quantities like chemical potential gradients.

Mathematical details are in [Chemical_potential_profile.pdf](https://github.com/jwjeffr/chemical_potential/blob/main/Chemical_potential_profile.pdf).
